## Personal Project

### Online Learning Management System

This project is an online learning management system designed to streamline the educational experience for students, teachers, and administrators. The system features a user-friendly web application where administrators have full control over the content, allowing them to upload, edit, and delete lectures and notes with ease.

Teachers are empowered to upload their lecture materials and notes, as well as update them as needed. This ensures that students have access to the most current educational resources.

For students, the platform offers a personalized learning experience. They can select their class and subjects, giving them access to relevant lecture videos and notes. Additionally, a comment section enables students to ask questions and seek clarification on topics directly from their teachers or peers.
